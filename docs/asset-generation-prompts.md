## Batch Generation Tips

**For Midjourney:**
- Run batches by tier (all Tier 1 scams in one session)
- Use `--repeat 4` for variations
- Create a style reference image first, then use `--sref [url]` for consistency

**For Pixellab:**
- Set canvas to 32x32 for icons, 64x64 for portraits
- Use consistent palette above
- Export at 1x then scale up with nearest-neighbor for crispy pixels
